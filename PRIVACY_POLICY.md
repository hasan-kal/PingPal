## 1. Data We Collect
PingPal collects only minimal information necessary for its features:
- **User IDs and Server IDs** (to track XP, levels, and leaderboards).
- **Message activity** counts (for XP calculation, not message content).
- **Timestamps** (e.g., when users join a server).

## 2. Data We Do NOT Collect
- PingPal does **not** log or store actual message content.
- PingPal does **not** collect personal information such as email addresses, passwords, or payment details.

## 3. Why We Collect Data
The collected data is used solely to provide the following features:
- XP and leveling system (`/rank`, `/leaderboard`).
- Server statistics (`/serverinfo`, `/userinfo`).
- Logging join/leave events (if enabled by the server).

---

## 4. Data Storage
- All data is stored locally using **SQLite**.
- Data may be reset, cleared, or deleted at any time without notice.

---

## 5. Data Sharing
- Collected data is **never shared** with third parties.
- Data is only used within Discord servers where PingPal is invited.

---

## 6. User Rights
- Server owners may request data deletion for their server at any time by removing PingPal.
